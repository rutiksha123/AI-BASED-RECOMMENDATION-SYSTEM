*DESCRIPTION* : 

This is the java program application which is designed to recommend music according or based on the user preferences and sample data. This java application is a basic music recommendation system which uses Apache Mahout libraries to suggest the songs to the user.
In this Java program application Java Swing, AWT, IO, Apache Mahout, etc. libraries are used. This Application user interactive GUI . the gui consists of a JLabel , JComboBox , JButton , ImageIcon and Image to provide an interactive application. The purpose of the program is to recommend user songs based on their preferences by using filtering . This system uses user based collaborative filtering , in which a sample dataset of user is analysed and recommendations are made based on their taste similarity . This program uses the FileDataModel of Apache Mahout library to read the sample dataset i.e the CSV (music.csv) file which is stored in the same directory. The similarity is calculated using the LogLikelihoodSimilarity of Apache Mahout between the users . It is a commonly used collaborative filtering technique which works efficiently on data like CSV. 5 users are selected which have very much similar taste of music and their preferences are used to generate the recommandations .
The GUI is developed using the javax.swing library toolkit . There is a JComboBox which contains a list of 20 songs. The user can select any of the songs mentioned in it , and can click on the “Recommend” button which will trigger an event. The program contains a single class “Music_Recomm_System” which implements the ActionListener Interface. The event that is triggered by the “Recommend” button is handled by the actionPerformed() method of ActionListener . On the click of that button 5 recommanded songs along with their names and thumbnail images are displayed on the frame . 
This task also gives us an idea that how recommended systems can be made for different types of domains like movie recommendation system, book recommendation system , product suggession system , and other content based platforms where user preference dataset is available. This task  also makes us aware of key concepts like collaborative filtering , similarity calculations/ computations  , and neighborhood finding in recommendation systems. 
This is a platform independent program application, because it is a java program, and it can run on any platform irrespective of whether you are using windows, Linux, Unix ,etc. making it platform independent. This type of recommendation systems are used by Spotify , JioSaavan , Gaana ,streaming paltforms like Netfilx , youtube etc. It can  be also used in blogs for suggesting different articles based on the user taste.
In conclusion, this java program application utilizes Apache Mahout to demonstrate the implementation of music recommendation system using collaborative filtering based on user preferences. By using the power of JAVA and Apache Mahout ,this system provides robust foundation for building more complex recommendation systems. With additional features and enhancements, the application can be made more robust and useful for a wider range of applications.
